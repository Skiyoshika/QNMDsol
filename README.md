**QNMDsol** is a high-performance Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) game control system built with **Rust**. It is designed to control demanding "Souls-like" action games (e.g., *Elden Ring*, *Code Vein*) using real-time EEG/EMG signals.

By interfacing with **OpenBCI** hardware and mapping biological signals to a **vJoy** virtual gamepad, QNMDsol allows players to attack, move, and interact with the game world using their mind and facial muscle signals.

## ✨ Features

* **🚀 Blazing Fast Core:** Powered by Rust's multi-threaded architecture, separating data acquisition, signal processing, and UI rendering for sub-millisecond latency.
* **🎮 Virtual Gamepad Integration:** Fully simulates an Xbox 360 controller via **vJoy**, supporting dual analog sticks, triggers, and ABXY buttons.
* **📈 Real-time Visualization:** A cyberpunk-styled GUI based on `egui`, offering 60FPS waveform rendering and visual controller feedback.
* **🧪 Dual Operation Modes:**
    * **Simulation Mode:** Built-in software signal generator. Use your keyboard to simulate brainwaves and test game mappings without hardware.
    * **Hardware Mode:** Direct connection to OpenBCI Cyton + Daisy (16-channel) via USB Dongle.
* **💾 AI-Ready Data Collection:** Integrated recorder to save raw 16-channel EEG data to CSV for training CSP/LDA or Deep Learning models.

## 🛠️ Architecture

The project follows a modular MVC-like structure:

* `src/main.rs`: Entry point and application lifecycle management.
* `src/engine.rs`: **The Brain**. Handles BrainFlow driver interaction, signal processing logic, and threshold detection.
* `src/gui.rs`: **The View**. Handles the egui interface, waveform plotting, and user interaction.
* `src/vjoy.rs`: **The Hand**. Wraps the Windows vJoy C interface for virtual controller output.
* `src/recorder.rs`: **The Memory**. Handles data logging to CSV files.

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

### Hardware
* **OpenBCI Cyton + Daisy Board** (16 Channels)
* OpenBCI Programmable USB Dongle

### Software
1.  **Windows 10 / 11** (64-bit)
2.  **Rust Toolchain** (Latest Stable)
3.  **[vJoy Driver](https://github.com/shauleiz/vJoy)** (Must be installed and configured)
4.  **BrainFlow Dynamic Libraries**:
    * `BoardController.dll`
    * `DataHandler.dll`
    * `vJoyInterface.dll`
    * *(Place these in the project root directory)*

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Setup
Clone the repository and ensure all DLLs are in the root folder.

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/QNMDsol.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/QNMDsol.git)
cd QNMDsol
# Copy BoardController.dll, DataHandler.dll, vJoyInterface.dll here!
```

### 2. Run Simulation (No Hardware Required)
Test the logic and game mapping immediately using the built-in simulator.

```bash
cargo run
```

1.  Select **SIM** mode in the top-left corner.
2.  Click **CONNECT** -> **START STREAM**.
3.  Use your **Keyboard** to simulate brain signals:
    * **W / A / S / D**: Left Stick (Movement)
    * **I / J / K / L**: Right Stick (Camera)
    * **Space**: Button A (Jump/Confirm)
    * **Z / X / C**: Buttons B / X / Y
    
### 3. Run Hardware Mode
Plug in the OpenBCI Dongle (Default: COM4).

Turn on the Cyton Board.

Select REAL mode in the GUI.

Click CONNECT. Once connected, click START STREAM.

Data Recording: Enter a label (e.g., "Attack") and click 🔴 RECORD to save training data.
