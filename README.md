**QNMDsol** is a high-performance Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) game control system built with **Rust**. It is designed to control demanding "Souls-like" action games (e.g., *Elden Ring*, *Code Vein*) using real-time EEG/EMG signals.

By interfacing with **OpenBCI** hardware and mapping biological signals to a **vJoy** virtual gamepad, QNMDsol allows players to attack, move, and interact with the game world using their mind and facial muscle signals.

## ✨ Features

* **🚀 Blazing Fast Core:** Powered by Rust's multi-threaded architecture, separating data acquisition, signal processing, and UI rendering for sub-millisecond latency.
* **🎮 Virtual Gamepad Integration:** Fully simulates an Xbox 360 controller via **vJoy**, supporting dual analog sticks, triggers, and ABXY buttons.
* **📈 Real-time Visualization:** A cyberpunk-styled GUI based on `egui`, offering 60FPS waveform rendering and visual controller feedback.
* **🧪 Dual Operation Modes:**
    * **Simulation Mode:** Built-in software signal generator. Use your keyboard to simulate brainwaves and test game mappings without hardware.
    * **Hardware Mode:** Direct connection to OpenBCI Cyton + Daisy (16-channel) via USB Dongle.
* **💾 AI-Ready Data Collection:** Integrated recorder to save raw 16-channel EEG data to CSV for training CSP/LDA or Deep Learning models.

---

## 🛠️ Architecture

The project follows a modular MVC-like structure:

* `src/main.rs`: Entry point and application lifecycle management.
* `src/engine.rs`: **The Brain**. Handles BrainFlow driver interaction, signal processing logic, and threshold detection.
* `src/gui.rs`: **The View**. Handles the egui interface, waveform plotting, and user interaction.
* `src/vjoy.rs`: **The Hand**. Wraps the Windows vJoy C interface for virtual controller output.
* `src/recorder.rs`: **The Memory**. Handles data logging to CSV files.

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

### Hardware
* **OpenBCI Cyton + Daisy Board** (16 Channels)
* OpenBCI Programmable USB Dongle

### Software
1.  **Windows 10 / 11** (64-bit)
2.  **Rust Toolchain** (Latest Stable)
3.  **[vJoy Driver](https://github.com/shauleiz/vJoy)** (Must be installed and configured)
4.  **BrainFlow Dynamic Libraries**:
    * `BoardController.dll`
    * `DataHandler.dll`
    * `vJoyInterface.dll`
    * *(Place these in the project root directory)*

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Setup
Clone the repository and ensure all DLLs are in the root folder.

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/QNMDsol.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/QNMDsol.git)
cd QNMDsol
# Copy BoardController.dll, DataHandler.dll, vJoyInterface.dll here!
```

### 2. Run Simulation (No Hardware Required)
Test the logic and game mapping immediately using the built-in simulator.

```bash
cargo run
```

1.  Select **SIM** mode in the top-left corner.
2.  Click **CONNECT** -> **START STREAM**.
3.  Use your **Keyboard** to simulate brain signals:
    * **W / A / S / D**: Left Stick (Movement)
    * **I / J / K / L**: Right Stick (Camera)
    * **Space**: Button A (Jump/Confirm)
    * **Z / X / C**: Buttons B / X / Y

### **2.1 🔴 【CRITICAL】Game Recognition Setup (XInput Translation)**

Modern games like Elden Ring only recognize the Xbox (XInput) standard controller, while QNMDsol simulates a generic controller (DirectInput). Therefore, a "translator" is required to bridge this gap.

**We strongly recommend using Steam's built-in "Steam Input" feature for this conversion. It is the cleanest and most stable solution as it requires no file injection.**

#### **Steam Input One-Time Setup Process:**

1.  **Preparation:** Launch Steam and ensure Elden Ring is in your Steam library (add it as a non-Steam game if necessary).
2.  **Generic Support:** Go to Steam -> **Settings** -> **Controller** -> Check **"Enable Generic Gamepad Configuration Support"**.
3.  **Enable Steam Input:** In the Steam Library, right-click Elden Ring -> **Properties** -> **Controller** -> Select **"Enable Steam Input"**.
4.  **Button Mapping:** Click **"Controller Layout"**. You must manually map the signals output by QNMDsol (e.g., **Button 1**, **Axis X/Y**) to the corresponding standard **Xbox 360 Buttons** (e.g., A button, Left Stick).
    * **💡 Tip:** To find the correct binding, run QNMDsol in **SIM mode** first, press the keyboard keys (`W/A/S/D`), and observe which axis is moving in the Steam mapping interface.

After completing these steps, the game will be able to recognize your mind-controlled gamepad.
    
### 3. Run Hardware Mode
Plug in the OpenBCI Dongle (Default: COM4).

Turn on the Cyton Board.

Select REAL mode in the GUI.

Click CONNECT. Once connected, click START STREAM.

Data Recording: Enter a label (e.g., "Attack") and click 🔴 RECORD to save training data.

## AI Pipeline (demo/offline)
- Run 	rainer\run_all.bat to convert PhysioNet EEGMI (R07-10) and train CSP+LDA, output rain_model.json in project root.
- GUI left panel supports setting model path and Load/Reload; right status panel shows per-class probabilities (random stub when no real inference).
- Classes map to: left/right/fists/feet (demo用途)，真实指令需用你自己的帽子重新采集/重训。
